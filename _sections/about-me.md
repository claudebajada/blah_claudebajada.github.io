I am currently building up a research team at the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/), focused on three 
research themes:

Establishing a clear, consistant description of the white matter anatomy of the human brain. <br />
Investigating the historical insights on white matter anatomy. <br />
Using novel computational approaches to explore the human connectome.

I graduated from medical school in 2010 and had two years experience as a practicing medical doctor. 
I proceeded to complete an MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience from University College London (distinction) 
under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Devlin. During the MSc I investigated the structural connectivity of 
the inferior frontal gyrus to the inferior parietal lobule and the anterior temporal lobe, areas that 
have been implicated in phonological and semantic processing of language. 
I completed a PhD at The University of Manchester under the supervision of Dr. Lauren Cloutman, 
Prof. Matthew Lambon Ralph and Prof. Geoff Parker. My project involved developing mathematical and neuroimaging 
approaches to understand the connectivity anatomy of the brain’s temporal lobe. My postdoctoral work has been at 
forschungszentrum jülich under the supervision of Prof Svenja Caspers and at the University of Malta under the
Supervision of Prof Richard Muscat and Dr Chris Zammit.
