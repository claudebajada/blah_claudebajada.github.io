An image from my latest journal article has made the cover of NeuroImage. The article is a product of my time as a postdoc at the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich working together with Svenja Caspers and Jan Schreiber. In the work we look at patterns prouced by the contrast generated by the length of connections (diffusion MRI streamline tractorgaphy) across the brain's outer shell (the cortex).

The full research article can be found <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.070>here</a>.
